# About the Project
 - The architecture is built using the MV pattern.

 - In this project, the absence of classes inheriting MonoBehaviour can be noticed, indicating a desire to distribute responsibilities among application components.

 - The project strictly adheres to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and is covered by tests, which is a good sign of a well-designed architecture and ensures stable application functionality.

 - It also employs clean Dependency Injection, which helps avoid dependencies on specific implementations and facilitates easy replacement of application components when needed.

 - An attempt has been made in this project to hide Unity code behind abstractions, making the code more understandable and convenient to work with.

 - The project includes a "toolkit" folder containing useful elements that can be used in many games. Some of these elements can be used as separate components, while others can be integrated into existing game systems. In the future, I plan to make this folder a separate package for Unity.

# Plugins used in the Project
 - DoTween
 - Odin inspector (not used frequently due to possible build issues)
 - UniTask
 - TMPro
 - NUnit
 - Addressables (not expert)

# Software Used
 - Unity
 - Rider
 - Vs code
 - Magica Voxel
 - Figma
 - Chat GPT

# Outcome 
 - Completing the first stage of the project significantly helped me improve the quality of my code and better understand the essence of OOP.
 - I have become more experienced in using C# and applying language constructs that were previously unfamiliar to me.
 - I have successfully solved tasks that seemed insurmountable to me before. 
 - All these skills and knowledge will be valuable to me in future projects and will help me create higher-quality and more scalable code.
